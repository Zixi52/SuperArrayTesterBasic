# SuperArray tester

This is a very simplified tester for your SuperArray. The purpose is to tell you if your SuperArray behaves as expected.

The output of `SuperArrayTester.java` should be EXACTLY:
``` 
1. PASS Empty List
2. PASS Add a few values
3. PASS Add MANY values
4. PASS Add values to front and middle, with resizing
5. PASS Add with resizing. Remove values to front end and middle.
6. PASS Test get/set
```

There should be no extra output.

# Exceptions

The `SuperArrayExceptionTester.java` tester must be completed by you to verify your exceptions happen when appropriate.
